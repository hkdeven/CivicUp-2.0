RiseUp    
===================

**This project is built with [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) on the [Stamplay](https://stamplay.com) platform to show you how to build community platform like [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) where users can create, search, comment, and vote on community initiatives.  This project was inspired by the earlier CivicUp project.**    


This platform will:    

* let users read and search every posting available on the site    
* let users signup using their GitHub account to interact with the content of the website    
* let logged in users propose new initiatives to the community    
* let logged in users upvote or down vote initiatives    
* let logged in users discuss initiatives in a comment thread
